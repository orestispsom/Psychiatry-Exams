# Clinical Psychopharmacology Reference Guide Redesign

Status: **ACTIVE — Stage 1A complete; Stage 1B next**

This folder is the durable clinical/editorial work surface for rebuilding the 613-page *Master Clinical Psychopharmacology Reference Compendium* into an approximately 200-page, high-clinical-value reference for psychiatrists, residents, students, and other clinicians.

The existing 613-page PDF is **source material**, not the document to edit in place. The redesign is intentionally separated into:

1. **Text / information architecture** — owned here in `Psychiatry-Exams/psychopharmacology/reference-guide/`.
2. **Design rules and page templates** — handed to `orestispsom/btb-production` once the manuscript is clinically/editorially stable.
3. **Final layout and PDF production** — manufactured and QA'd in `orestispsom/btb-production` under its production rules.

`orestispsom/Medication-Guide` is an app/consumer of psychopharmacology data and is **not** the canonical manuscript or publication-design repository for this guide.

Do not compress the current PDF visually to hit the page target. Reduce duplication, normalize hierarchy, and rewrite into canonical content records first.

## Editorial north star

The finished guide should function as a fast clinical retrieval system:

**Choose → Dose → Monitor → Manage problems → Understand why**

A clinician opening a drug or protocol page should be able to identify the practical answer within seconds. Mechanistic pharmacology remains important, but it should explain prescribing rather than dominate page real estate.

## Core rules

- One clinical fact should have one canonical home.
- Repeated appearances should be context-specific overlays or cross-references, not copied monographs.
- Page count is controlled in text architecture, not by shrinking type.
- Major drugs may receive one full page; secondary drugs should usually share pages; lower-frequency/similar agents belong in matrices.
- Complex protocols may receive a full page or spread; straightforward switches should be matrix/half-page material.
- Special-population and organ-impairment chapters modify canonical drug records rather than duplicating them.
- Clinical claims, doses, contraindications, monitoring, pregnancy, licensing, and interactions require current authoritative verification before publication.
- Final design direction and release remain human approval gates.

## Project sequence

### Stage 0 — Editorial architecture
Define content types, canonical homes, and rewrite schemas.

### Stage 1 — Text
- **1A Inventory — COMPLETE**
- 1B Rewrite C1 Foundations
- 1C Rewrite C2 Antipsychotics
- 1D Rewrite C3 Antidepressants
- 1E Rewrite C4 Bipolar / Mood Stabilizers
- 1F Rewrite C5 Anxiety / Sleep / ADHD
- 1G Rewrite C6 SUD / Movement / Catatonia
- 1H Rewrite C7 Special Populations / Neuro / Organ
- 1I Rewrite C8 Switching / Deprescribing
- 1J Global consistency/compression pass
- 1K Assemble master manuscript and project page count

### Stage 2 — Design system
Handoff the approved manuscript to `btb-production`. Prototype six representative pages, test at 100% print/tablet/laptop scale, then freeze typography, grid, spacing, semantic components, table rules, profile rules, protocol rules, and navigation.

### Stage 3 — Layout / final PDF
In `btb-production`, lay out by chunk, QA every batch, integrate, regenerate contents/index/cross-references, complete clinical/editorial/visual QA, then produce the final PDF.

## Stage 1A

See [`stage-1a/README.md`](stage-1a/README.md).

## Working rule for future agents

**Do not rewrite sequentially from source PDF page 1 to page 613. Work from the Stage 1A editorial units and canonical destinations.**

The Stage 1A inventory is editorial planning, not clinical validation. Its classifications may be refined during rewriting when source semantics demand it.
